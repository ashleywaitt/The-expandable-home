# The-Expandable-Home
<!DOCTYPE html>

Background: 
The UK is in a housing crisis, with 300,000 homes needing to be built per year, the UK is currently achieving 50% of this. By continuing to deliver 150,000 homes per year, it is predicted by 2025 the UK will have housing targets of 750,000 homes needed per year. Alongside the worsening housing crisis, there is a rise of loneliness and an aura of uncertainty upon the British people. Change is needed!

The Expandable Home develops upon WikiHouse construction methods and seeks to question National Housing Technical Space Standards, arguing through communal self builds and delivering smaller private spaces we can increase the sense of community and achieve pressuring housing needs. Through detailed demographic analysis, a diverse home for life that can adapt and grow to the needs of people has been created at a total cost of £20,000 - £30,000 and can be built within 3-4 days. 

‘How to Build a Community’ identifies the site. 58 military barracks that are being sold by 2032, available throughout the UK. It argues that by gifting the sites to local communities, local authorities can help economically benefit their areas in the longevity, rather than for short financial gains.

‘The Instruction Manual’ gives detailed instructions on how to build one of these homes and issue 2 will address the ease of expansion that has been identified in the ‘Final Frame R&D’ pdf. 

Please see below for the abstract to the project.

‘Context:
Throughout “Sapiens- A Brief History of Humankind” Dr. Yuval Noah Harari argues that Homo Sapiens are social animals and that the Digital Revolution is asking Sapiens to evolve faster than ever in our history. Theoretically the Digital Revolution offers infinite opportunities for social exchange, knowledge transfer and social mobility and yet, paradoxically, the UK population is experiencing alarming statistics of social and economic division, loneliness and isolation. The once social animal is now struggling to keep pace with evolutionary demands, resulting in a frustrated and antisocial UK. As feelings of disfranchisement and disempowerment grow, alongside unaffordable contexts, this generation has been raised in a social media world. Yet, alarming statistics from Generation Z are starting to show the rejection of social media platforms and traditional social constructs. Resulting in a generation rethinking the live, work and learning patterns passed from our predecessors, as well as rediscovering analogue, rather than digital, social networks. Through Co Habitation, Co-Living, Co-Working models Open Source Learning and Free Ware initiatives the sharing of physical, intellectual and technological space is increasing, becoming the norm, rather than the exception.

Thesis: 
Within this context, this thesis explores different of models dwelling, through retrofitting and governed space standards, developing a mixed-use proposal that focuses upon progressing a live, work, free knowledge and skills exchange co-living model, which has the potential to be a viable alternative to the current UK housing crisis. Through sharing and cohabitation, this thesis, explores a substitute to current housing policies and addresses issues of affordability, social mobility, exchange and healing whilst creating a physical truly social network. 

Site: 
The mass disposal of M.O.D Barracks sites within our Cities provides the potential canvas for beginning to explore the formation of this societal shift. Economically by Local Authorities, gifting this land to the vulnerable and gaining capital from those able to do so, this thesis argues that the longer-term State burden of providing social housing, adult education, un-employment and sickness benefits could be proven to be dramatically reduced through long term goals, rather than a short financial gain. Conceptually the historic physical and social structures of the barrack’s highly controlled micro community, which has a wider role in the protection of society, provides an interesting counter point to, and synergy with, the emerging thesis. These sites provide existing infrastructure, which are explored through time lined phases within this thesis, and is developed upon to maximize the sites potential, reduce financial burdens on the Local Authorities, whilst creating a in a co-living community.’

Thank you for taking the time to read through my research and development. This project has shown how practical this new technology is and through challenging conventional construction methods, we can help address real current issues the UK is facing.
Please feel free to contribute, question and contact.

Many Thanks,
